MHD is a file format often used for storing 3D medical image data. In many cases the MHD file format is selected over DICOM for freely downloadable datasets (e.g. https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/). It is intended that the notebook provided can be used to open such files and perform segmentation through clustering.
